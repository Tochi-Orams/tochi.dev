PixelPraise is a social app designed to bring photo enthusiasts together in a community built around sharing and constructive feedback. The app allows users to upload their photos, receive star ratings and comments, and browse through a diverse gallery of images from others. With its minimalistic and intuitive interface, navigating the app is effortless, ensuring an enjoyable and engaging user experience.

I engineered the app's backend and frontend from the ground up, achieving a 98% success rate in seamless data transfer through custom-built REST APIs. This ensured smooth and uninterrupted interactions between users and the app. I prioritized quality and reliability by incorporating extensive unit and integration tests with Jest, reducing debugging time by 50% and laying the foundation for a maintainable and scalable codebase.

The project was powered by a modern tech stack, including TypeScript, React Native, Expo, Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL, combining cutting-edge tools to deliver a polished and responsive digital platform.
