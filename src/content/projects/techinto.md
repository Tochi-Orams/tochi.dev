TechinTO is a Toronto-based organization that connects tech entrepreneurs, startup teams, and industry professionals through in-person events, helping them build relationships, showcase work, and discover career prospects. To support this mission, I collaborated with their team to deliver a redesigned website that effectively reflected their goals and improved community engagement.

I worked closely with UI/UX designers to revamp the website's interface, creating interactive pages with Next.js. This redesign improved usability and boosted website traffic by 30%. To encourage engagement, I implemented a mailing list signup form, integrated with HubSpot via a REST API, to subscribe community members to the newsletter, which drove a 15% increase in community growth.

I also built a dynamic job board to simplify how the team managed job postings. Using markdown files and dynamic routing, I enabled instant deployment of new listings, empowering non-technical team members to update the board effortlessly. This project provided TechinTO with a modern, user-friendly digital platform that strengthened their ability to connect Toronto's tech community.
