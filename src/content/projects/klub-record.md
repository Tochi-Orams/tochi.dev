KLUB RECORD is a rapidly growing record label that needed a centralized digital presence to keep pace with its expanding roster and fan base. I launched and currently maintain the label’s primary website, serving as the central source of truth for their digital ecosystem.

### Key Contributions

- **E-commerce & Streaming Integration:** Integrated merchandise sales and direct links to playlists and streaming platforms to streamline the fan experience.
- **Ongoing Maintenance:** Provided continuous support to ensure the site scales alongside the label’s growth and handles traffic spikes during high-profile releases.

### Impact

- **Conversion Optimization:** Streamlined the path from artist discovery to merchandise purchase and streaming, centralizing the label’s revenue and engagement streams.
