The SickKids PICU Clinic site was designed to serve as a comprehensive hub for patients and their families, providing all the essential information needed for follow-up appointments. The site's flagship feature was a smart survey system that guided users to complete required pre-appointment surveys while maintaining compliance with privacy standards by avoiding the collection of protected health information.

I designed and developed the site's accessible and user-friendly interface, simplifying the process of accessing appointment information and pre-appointment requirements. The intuitive form flow directed patients or caregivers to relevant surveys based on their input, while a custom-built readiness dashboard allowed users to track their survey progress and ensure they were fully prepared for their appointments.

Though the website was ultimately not deployed due to JavaScript compatibility issues with the existing SickKids CMS, the project highlighted my ability to create tailored, privacy-conscious solutions that prioritize user experience and accessibility.
