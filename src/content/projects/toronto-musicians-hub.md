I designed and built a scalable, user-friendly event website using Next.js, focusing on accessibility and a seamless user experience. Through A/B testing and analyzing user behavior with tools like Mouseflow, I refined layouts to remove barriers to conversions and drive higher engagement. To keep the site running smoothly, I implemented CI/CD pipelines with Vercel and GitHub, enabling bug-free zero-downtime deployments and quick updates.

Integrating Shopify for e-commerce, I developed sales tracking workflows and tailored post-purchase experiences using Liquid scripting. To support affiliates and partners, I built automated dashboards with Node.js and Shopify's GraphQL API, making it easy to track ticket sales and payouts.

Outside of development, I led marketing efforts through email campaigns and social media. I automated audience segmentation in Mailchimp, improving campaign efficiency by 40%, and grew our social media following by 2,200 in just eight months through creative content creation. By combining technical skills with thoughtful design and automation, I delivered a platform that not only enhanced user experience but also simplified operations for everyone involved.
