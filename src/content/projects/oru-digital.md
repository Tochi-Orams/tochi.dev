### Description

Oru.Digital is an entrepreneurial venture designed to bridge the gap for software engineers from non-traditional backgrounds. The platform acts as a "Senior Engineer in a box," providing the structure, architectural planning, and cohesion necessary to manage complex software projects for individual developers and small teams.

### Key Contributions

- **AI-Driven Scoping:** Developed an interactive chatbot interface using **LLMs** that interviews users about their project motivations, user base, and budgetary restrictions to generate a comprehensive project brief and architectural plan.
- **Intelligent Task Estimation:** Built logic to handle automated task breakdowns, estimation, and "critical path" determination—recommending the optimal order of tasks based on prerequisite markers.
- **Skill-Tailored Assignments:** Created a profile-based matching system where task descriptions and the level of guidance provided are dynamically adjusted based on the user's specified skills and proficiency levels.

### Impact

- **Intelligent Automation:** Successfully built out all major AI features, including the brief generation and task assignment engines.
- **Educational Growth:** Designed a framework that allows engineers to learn and grow while working on projects by providing "just-in-time" guidance rather than removing them from the decision-making process.
- **Structural Cohesion:** Provided individual developers with the ability to manage scope and timeline with the same precision as a professional project manager.
