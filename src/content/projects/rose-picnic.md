As the lead engineer for the Rosé Picnic platform, I was responsible for a comprehensive digital transformation of their event management and public-facing presence. This involved architecting a high-performance exhibitor portal to handle complex vendor logistics and executing a complete migration of their main website to a modern tech stack.

### Key Contributions

- **Exhibitor Portal & Admin Dashboard:** Built a full-stack portal using **Next.js and PostgreSQL** that automated vendor onboarding, document submission, and requirement tracking. I also engineered an internal dashboard with advanced filtering and real-time payment tracking to replace manual coordination.
- **Modern Web Migration:** Led the transition of the public-facing site from WordPress to **Next.js**, focusing on performance, accessibility, and SEO. This migration included a modular UI component library that accelerated feature development by 35%.
- **Data-Driven UI/UX:** Collaborated with marketing to leverage **Google Analytics** for behavior analysis, shipping iterative UI enhancements that directly optimized conversion paths.
- **DevOps Excellence:** Implemented a robust CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions and Vercel** for automated testing and zero-downtime deployments, ensuring the site remained stable during high-traffic ticket launches.

### Impact

- **80% Operational Efficiency:** The portal transformed a manual multi-day task for several personnel into an asynchronous process managed by a single team member.
- **Revenue Growth:** The website redesign and performance optimizations drove a **20% increase in user engagement** and an **18% boost in ticket sales**.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Replaced a legacy CMS with a modern, modular architecture, enabling faster iterations and consistent branding across the entire platform.
