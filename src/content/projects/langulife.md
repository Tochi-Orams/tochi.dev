Langulife is a language learning app that takes a unique approach by enabling users to learn foreign languages through real conversations with native speakers. It combines interactive voice and text-based quizzes with social features that encourage meaningful peer-to-peer interactions and community building.

### Key Contributions

- **Architectural Optimization:** Stepped in at an early stage to reengineer the foundation, identifying critical areas for optimization to create a scalable standard for development. This included reengineering backend systems using **Node.js, Supabase, and GCP** to improve data reliability.
- **Cross-Platform & Native Development:** Transformed Figma designs into dynamic **React Native** components, while utilizing **Swift and Kotlin** for specialized native modules to provide a unique, high-performance feel.
- **Quality Assurance:** Introduced rigorous **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices using **Jest**, which enhanced overall app stability by 80% and allowed for early bug detection.
- **State & Cache Management:** Implemented advanced state management and caching strategies to reduce network traffic and improve the user experience in low-connectivity environments.

### Impact

- **Performance Gains:** Optimized loading times by **35%** and reduced network traffic by **60%**, significantly lowering infrastructure costs and improving user retention.
- **System Stability:** Improved error handling and backend reliability, leading to a **20% reduction in user-facing errors** and an **80% boost in overall app stability**.
- **Increased Engagement:** The delivery of a more intuitive, interactive interface resulted in a **15% boost in user engagement** metrics during initial testing.
