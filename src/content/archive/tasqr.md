tasQR is a task app that helps users form better habits and routines in their daily lives. Instead of giving users a simple to-do list, with tasQR, users register tasks to various QR codes that they can place in the vicinity of their specified task. Users will then be able to simply scan the QR code to start or end a task. This allows tasQR to track the user's completion of tasks and give them reports in the app's dashboard so that the users can track their habits and better manage their time!
