The Little Lemon reservations web app was the capstone project of the Meta Front-End Developer Certification I completed in 2023. It combines design with technical foundation, showcasing a highly interactive table booking system designed to deliver a seamless and personalized experience for restaurant guests.

<br />

The project included designing an eye-catching landing page for this fictional restaurant to create a visually appealing and user-friendly introduction to the brand. The core highlight, however, was the dynamic reservations page. Built with real-time interactivity, users could input their preferences and immediately receive feedback on table availability. This was powered by a mocked scheduling API that dynamically generated table availability, simulating real-world backend functionality.

<br />

To make the experience as realistic as possible, I implemented client-side state management to handle updates seamlessly and optimized the user flow for both speed and clarity. The app demonstrates not only the technical capabilities gained through the course but also a deep understanding of user-centric design, creating a product that is both functional and delightful to use.
