I developed a scalable and visually engaging website for QuantumApps using Next.js, enabling businesses to easily discover the available digital transformation services and book consultation calls. By prioritizing interactive elements and streamlining user journeys, we increased consultation requests by 20%.

To maximize the browsing experience, I began the project by conducting research on UI/UX trends in the digital agency space. With this information, I created high-fidelity Figma prototypes, which I then translated into reusable code components. I also built an automated page generation system, cutting manual development time by 50%.

The website features integrations with the SendGrid and Calendly APIs to automate email communications and enable straightforward consultation booking and rescheduling. These features led to a 30% boost in lead conversions and further empowered QuantumApps to connect with clients and achieve their digital transformation goals.
