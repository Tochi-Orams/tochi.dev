        I designed and built a scalable, user-friendly event website using
        Next.js, focusing on accessibility and a seamless user experience.
        Through A/B testing and analyzing user behavior with tools like
        Mouseflow, I refined layouts to remove barriers to conversions and drive
        higher engagement. To keep the site running smoothly, I implemented
        CI/CD pipelines with Vercel and GitHub, enabling bug-free zero-downtime
        deployments and quick updates. <br />
        <br />
        Integrating Shopify for e-commerce, I developed sales tracking workflows
        and tailored post-purchase experiences using Liquid scripting. To
        support affiliates and partners, I built automated dashboards with
        Node.js and Shopify's GraphQL API, making it easy to track ticket sales
        and payouts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of development, I led marketing efforts through email campaigns
        and social media. I automated audience segmentation in Mailchimp,
        improving campaign efficiency by 40%, and grew our social media
        following by 2,200 in just eight months through creative content
        creation. By combining technical skills with thoughtful design and
        automation, I delivered a platform that not only enhanced user
        experience but also simplified operations for everyone involved.

        I developed a scalable and visually engaging website for QuantumApps
        using Next.js, enabling businesses to easily discover the available
        digital transformation services and book consultation calls. By
        prioritizing interactive elements and streamlining user journeys, we
        increased consultation requests by 20%. <br />
        <br />
        To maximize the browsing experience, I began the project by conducting
        research on UI/UX trends in the digital agency space. With this
        information, I created high-fidelity Figma prototypes, which I then
        translated into reusable code components. I also built an automated page
        generation system, cutting manual development time by 50%.
        <br />
        <br />
        The website features integrations with the SendGrid and Calendly APIs to
        automate email communications and enable straightforward consultation
        booking and rescheduling. These features led to a 30% boost in lead
        conversions and further empowered QuantumApps to connect with clients
        and achieve their digital transformation goals.

        Langulife is a language learning app that takes a unique approach by
        enabling users to learn foreign languages through real conversations
        with native speakers. It combines interactive voice and text-based
        quizzes, designed get users comfortable with new languages, with social
        features that encourage meaningful interactions. <br /> <br />
        I joined the project in its early stages, stepping in to improve the
        foundation after the initial developer was unable to continue. One of my
        first priorities was identifying areas for optimization, creating a more
        maintainable and scalable standard for developing and testing the app.
        Collaborating closely with designers, the product manager, and
        prospective users, I worked to ensure every aspect of the user
        experience was intuitive, engaging, and aligned with the app's vision.
        <br /> <br />
        Some of the most impactful contributions included optimizing loading
        times by 35% and reducing network traffic by 60% through improved state
        management and caching strategies. I also enhanced app stability by 80%,
        introducing rigorous test-driven development (TDD) practices with Jest
        to catch potential issues early. On the backend, I reengineered critical
        systems using Node.js, PostgreSQL, Supabase, and Google Cloud Platform
        (GCP), improving error handling and data reliability while reducing
        user-facing errors by 20%. On the frontend, I transformed Figma designs
        into dynamic React Native UI components, resulting in a 15% boost in
        user engagement thanks to a cleaner, more intuitive interface.

      <p>
        The Little Lemon reservations web app was the capstone project of the
        Meta Front-End Developer Certification I completed in 2023. It combines
        design with technical foundation, showcasing a highly interactive table
        booking system designed to deliver a seamless and personalized
        experience for restaurant guests.
        <br />
        <br />
        The project included designing an eye-catching landing page for this
        fictional restaurant to create a visually appealing and user-friendly
        introduction to the brand. The core highlight, however, was the dynamic
        reservations page. Built with real-time interactivity, users could input
        their preferences and immediately receive feedback on table
        availability. This was powered by a mocked scheduling API that
        dynamically generated table availability, simulating real-world backend
        functionality.
        <br />
        <br />
        To make the experience as realistic as possible, I implemented
        client-side state management to handle updates seamlessly and optimized
        the user flow for both speed and clarity. The app demonstrates not only
        the technical capabilities gained through the course but also a deep
        understanding of user-centric design, creating a product that is both
        functional and delightful to use.

        I worked closely with UI/UX designers to revamp the website's interface,
        creating interactive pages with Next.js. This redesign improved
        usability and boosted website traffic by 30%. To encourage engagement, I
        implemented a mailing list signup form, integrated with HubSpot via a
